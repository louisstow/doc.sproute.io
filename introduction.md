## Introduction

Welcome to the Sproute documentation. Before diving into the docs, be sure to watch some **[tutorial videos](/videos)**. After watching a few episodes you'll be able to write the docs yourself.

### Core Concepts

1. [**Pages**](/docs/pages) are pages of HTML which may have template tags inside using the powerful template language.

2. [**Models**](/docs/models) are a definition of your data. You should define what type of data you expect for security reasons.

3. [**Routes**](/docs/routes) is the mapping from requested URLs to views that should be rendered in the browser.

### Working with Data

- [**HTTP interface**](/docs/database) is how you interact with data.

- [**Users**](/docs/users) are built into Sproute applications.

### Tweaking

- <p>[**Config**](/docs/config) lets you tweak settings about your space.</p>

### Security

- [**Permissions**](/docs/permissions) let you decide what kind of users can access what parts of the website, be it pages, rows of data and even fields of data.

- [**Access property**](/docs/model#access) on models definitions.
