## Introduction

Welcome to the Sproute documentation. Before diving into the docs, be sure to sit back and watch the many **[tutorial videos](/videos)**. After watching a few episodes you'll be able to write the docs yourself.

Sproute implements a tried and tested concept known as MVC or Model View Controller. You may be overwhelmed by acronyms by now but this is a simple one. It essentially means a segregation of data (the model) and how it's displayed (the view), a controller decides which model needs which view.

At the very least, your app needs some views and a controller. Not all websites need dynamic data.

A [**view**](/docs/views) is a page of HTML which may have further actions inside using the powerful template language.

A [**model**](/docs/model) is a definition of your data.

The [**controller**](/docs/controller) is the mapping from URLs to views to render.
