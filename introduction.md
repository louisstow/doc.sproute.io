## Introduction

Welcome to the Sproute documentation. Before diving into the docs, be sure to watch some **[tutorial videos](/videos)**. After watching a few episodes you'll be able to write the docs yourself.

### Core Concepts

1. [**Pages**](/docs/pages) are HTML files which may have template tags inside using the powerful template language.

2. [**Models**](/docs/models) are a definition of your data. You should define what type of data you expect for security reasons.

3. [**Routes**](/docs/routes) is the mapping from requested URLs to views that should be rendered in the browser.

4. [**Permissions**](/docs/permissions) let you decide what kind of users can access what parts of the space.

### Working with Data

- [**HTTP interface**](/docs/rest) is how you interact with data. Also known as REST.

- [**Users**](/docs/users) are built into Sproute spaces that allow logins and registering.

- [**Config**](/docs/config) settings for your space.
