# Getting Started &amp; Installation

First of all you should download the required dependencies to run a Sproute application. Sproute relies on the following technologies:

- [Node.js (> 0.10.8)](http://nodejs.org)
- [Mongodb (> 2.4.3)](http://mongodb.org)

For installation on **OSX** or **Linux**, change directory to the `posix` directory in the package. Execute `install.sh`.

For installation on **Windows**, double-click `install.bat` under the `windows` directory in the package.

Now that everything is installed, let's take a look at your newly downloaded package from purchasing a license.
