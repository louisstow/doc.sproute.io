# Pages

A page is an HTML file with template tags. The template language allows you to request data, include pages, evaluate expressions, set and render variables. To render a page you need a matching [route](/docs/routes) to point to the page.

Template tags are wrapped with two curly braces starting with `{{` and ending with `}}`.

When you want to evaluate a variable inside a tag, use either a colon at the start `:myVariable`, or wrap the variable in a dollar sign and two parenthesis `$(myVariable)`. Some tags will automatically evaluate the variable like `if` and `set` or when documented as `<variable>`.

## Tags
### {{ get &lt;url&gt; [&lt;role&gt;] as &lt;variable&gt; }}
- `url`: URL to retrieve data from the database.
- `role`: Role of the user to make the GET request as (optional).
- `variable`: Save the data in the variable provided.

Retrieve data from the database through the [HTTP interface](/docs/rest#GET). The result is placed in the variable you provide after `as`.

You may optionally provide a [user type](/docs/permissions#user-types) to make the request as a different role if the logged in user would otherwise not be able to complete.

*Note: This will not work for every URL, only paths to the [HTTP interface](/docs/rest).*

~~~
{{ get /data/articles/ as articles }}
{{ each articles as article }}
	<h1>{{article.title}}</h1>
	{{article.body}}
{{ /each }}
~~~

### {{ post &lt;url&gt; &lt;data&gt; [&lt;role&gt;] as &lt;variable&gt; }}
- `url`: URL to store data in the database.
- `data`: Name of the object variable with the data to store.
- `role`: Role of the user to make the GET request as (optional).
- `variable`: Save the response in the variable provided.

Store data in the database through the [HTTP interface](/docs/rest#POST). The result is placed in the variable you provide after `as`.

With this tag you may modify data that the logged in user would otherwise not have permission to complete by manually entering a [user type](/docs/permissions#user-types). This is useful for creating pages that require special logic or processing before storing the data.

*Note: This will not work for every URL, only paths to the [HTTP interface](/docs/rest).*

~~~
{{ set data.title Hello }}
{{ set data.body Goodbye }}
{{ post /data/articles/ data admin as articles }}
~~~

### {{ each &lt;collection&gt; as &lt;variable&gt; }}
- `collection`: List of data to iterate through.
- `variable`: Name of the variable containing each item.

Iterate over a list of data. Usually you will use this with the `get` tag which will retrieve the data as a list. Everything inside the `each` block will be repeated for each of the elements in the collection.

### {{ if &lt;variable&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable to test.
- `operator`: Operator for expression. See list below.
- `value`: Value to test.

Use this tag to only evaluate nested tags and HTML based on an expression.

Available operators:

- `eq`, `=`: Variable **equals** value.
- `gt`, `>`: Variable is **greater** than value.
- `lt`, `<`: Variable is **less** than value.
- `gte`, `>=`: Variable is **greater than or equal** to value. 
- `lte`, `<=`: Variable is **less than or equal** to value.
- `neq`, `!=`: Variable is **not equal** to value.

~~~
{{ if articles.length gt 0 }}
	<p>List of articles</p>
{{ /if }}
~~~

### {{ unless &lt;variable&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt; }}

Same as `if` but negated.

### {{ else }}
Use this tag in conjuction with `if`. If the expression is not true, tags nested in the else will be evaluated instead.

~~~
{{ if articles.length gt 0 }}
	<p>List of articles</p>
{{ else }}
	<p>No articles found!</p>
{{ /if }}
~~~

### {{ set &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable to set a value.
- `value`: Value to set the variable to.

Set a variable to a value. If the variable contains a dot `.` the name before the dot will be turned into an object with whatever property comes after the dot. If the property name needs to contain a dot, you can wrap the name in double-quotes.

~~~
{{ set pageTitle This is the title of my website }}
<title>{{pageTitle}}</title>

{{ set obj.property 1 }}
{{ set obj.a.very.deep.property 2 }}
{{ set obj."property.with.dot" 3 }}
{{ debug obj }}
~~~

### {{ array &lt;variable&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable to convert to an array.

Convert an object into an array. The object must contain numeric keys which will turn into the array indexes. If the object has no `length` property, one will be generated by the number of keys.

~~~
{{ set obj.0 First }}
{{ set obj.1 Second }}
{{ array obj }}
{{ debug obj }}
~~~

### {{ expr &lt;variable&gt; &lt;expr&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable to store the result of the expression.
- `expr`: Mathematical expression.

This is a slightly advanced function to perform calculations. The result of the expression is stored in the variable provided.

See the [MathJS](http://mathjs.org) docs for more information about available operators and Math functions.

~~~
{{ expr score :article.thumbsUp - :article.thumbsDown }}
{{ score }}
~~~

### {{ date &lt;date&gt; &lt;format&gt; }}
- `date`: The date to format in UNIX timestamp form.
- `format`: A special string to format a date

Uses the [Moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) library to take a UNIX timestamp and format it. Every row in a model has a `_created` field that can be formatted.

~~~
{{ each rows as row }}
	{{ date :row._created h:mma }}
{{ / }}
~~~

### {{ ago &lt;date&gt; }}
- `date`: The date as a UNIX timestamp.

Returns a text representation of the time elapsed from now. Read more in the [Moment docs](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/).

~~~
{{ ago :row._created }}
~~~

### {{ word &lt;variable&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;offset&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable containing text content to splice.

Will split the text variable by words and print based on the start index until the offset.

~~~
First 10 words from article:
{{ word :row.body 0 10 }}
~~~


### {{ include &lt;file&gt; }}
- `file`: Include a text-file into the page.

Include and evaluate another page. Can also be plain HTML. Will only search in the current directory.

`{{ #include }}` will do the same but will not evaluate the template tags.

~~~
{{ include header.sprt }}
<p>Body content</p>
{{ include footer.sprt }}
~~~

### {{ &lt;variable&gt; }}

Will replace the tag with the variable contents in the HTML rendered. By default the value will replace all HTML with HTML entities (`<` is replaced with `&lt;`). This is for security reasons to prevent XSS where users can inject JavaScript into your webpage.

`{{ #<variable> }}` will do the same but will not escape the HTML. This should only be used if the data is trusted, such as if an administrator created it.

~~~
<p>{{myVar}}</p>
~~~

### {{ / }}
Required to close open tags such as `if` and `each`. You may put any text after the backslash to help remember which tag it's closing.

~~~
{{ if someExpression }}

{{ /I can be anything }}
~~~

### {{ redirect &lt;url&gt; }}
- `url`: Path to redirect to.

Will stop all processing of the page and redirect the user to the path specified.

~~~
{{ unless session.user }}
	{{ redirect /login }}
{{ / }}
~~~

### {{ debug &lt;variable&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable to print.

Print all the properties and values on a variable. Runs `JSON.stringify` on the provided variable and wraps it in `<pre>` tags.

~~~
{{ debug self }}
~~~

### {{ error &lt;message&gt; }}
- `message`: Error message to display.

Stop processing the page and respond to the user with a `500` code and a JSON string of the error. You can render a page instead of a JSON string by changing the Error View to an error page in Config. 

~~~
{{ error Page could not be displayed }}
~~~

### {{ json &lt;variable&gt; }}
- `variable`: Variable to respond as JSON.

Stop processing the page and respond to the user with a JSON string of the variable passed. Will serve with Content-Type `application/json`.

~~~
{{ set myobj.x 1 }}
{{ set myobj.y 2 }}
{{ set myobj.z 3 }}
{{ json myobj }}
~~~

### Escaping the tag
If you actually want two curly braces in your page without it being a tag, you can use an HTML entity (`&amp;#123;`) or put a forwardslash before the tag `\{{`.

## Global Variables
When rendering a page, you have access to a variety of variables.

### params
This object contains the placeholders specified from the [routes](/docs/routes).

### query
URLs can have query variables (e.g. `?queryOption=hi`). You can access this through the `query` object.

~~~
{{ query.name }}
~~~

*Alias: `$_GET`*

### form
Pages can have data posted to it. This post data is found under the `form` object.

~~~
{{ if form }}
	{{ debug form }}
{{ / }}
~~~

*Alias: `$_POST`*

### headers
All the request headers sent to the page in lower-case.

~~~
{{ if headers.referer }}
	{{ redirect :headers.referer }}
{{ / }}
~~~

### session
The built-in user accounts are attached to the session object. You will mainly be using the user account at `session.user`. This contains the entire logged in user object. If the user is not logged-in this value will be empty.

### self
Assorted variables are contained in the `self` object.

* `url`: The requested URL being rendered.
* `dir`: Directory of the page being rendered.
* `name`: Name of the space.
* `method`: HTTP method making the request.
